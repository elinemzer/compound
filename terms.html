    <p>You should carefully consider all risks before you make an investment decision with respect to the common shares of NY Residential REIT, LLC (the “Company”).
    This material must be read in conjunction with the applicable offering documents in order to understand fully all of the implications and risks of the offering of securities to which it relates and a copy of the offering documents must be made available to you in connection with any offering. All information contained in this material is qualified by the terms of applicable offering documents. Neither the SEC nor any other regulatory body has approved or disapproved or passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of the information presented in this material.</p>

    <p>This material has been prepared by the Company solely for informational purposes based on its own information, as well as information from public sources. This material has been prepared to assist interested parties in making their own evaluation of the Company and does not purport to contain all of the information that may be relevant. In all cases, interested parties should conduct their own investigation and analysis of the Company, and the data set forth in this material and other information provided by or on behalf of the Company.</p>

    <p>Certain of the information contained herein may be derived from information provided by industry sources. The Company believes that such information is accurate and that the sources from which it has been obtained are reliable. The Company cannot guarantee the accuracy of such information, however, and has not independently verified such information.</p>

    <p>Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Any historical returns, expected returns, or probability projections may not reflect actual future performance.</p>

    <p>This material contains forward-looking statements, which reflect the Company’s beliefs, assumptions and expectations of the Company’s future performance, taking into account all information currently available to the Company. These beliefs, assumptions and expectations are subject to risks and uncertainties and can change as a result of many possible events or factors, not all of which are known to the Company. Actual results could vary materially from those set forth in such forward-looking statements.

    <p>This is an offering conducted under Tier II of Regulation A. Such offerings are commonly known as Regulation A+ offerings. The Company will not start operations until the Company has raised at least $1,000,000 in this offering (including any purchases by affiliates of the Company or its sponsor).

    <p><strong>Notices</strong></p>

    <p>Compound Asset Management, LLC (“Compound”) operates a Website at getcompound.com (the “Site”). Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Any historical returns, expected returns, or probability projections may not reflect actual future performance. All securities involve risk and may result in partial or total loss.

    <p><strong>Investment Characteristics</strong></p>
    <p>Although Compound carefully evaluates potential returns based on historic performance, Compound makes no representation regarding the likelihood or probability that any actual or proposed investment will in fact achieve a particular investment outcome or goal. Past performance is not a guarantee of future success, and in fact volatility means that returns in any period may be far above or below those of previous period.  Investments may lose value. Compound is unable to predict or forecast market fluctuations or other uncertainties that may affect the value of any investment. You are urged to use all available resources to educate yourself about investing in general. Additionally, market conditions and your personal financial circumstances may change – perhaps suddenly or maybe gradually over time. Monitoring your holdings to suit changing circumstances is your responsibility, and it is recommended that you reassess any investing program on a regular basis to ensure that it remains consistent with your current financial resources and investment objectives.</p>
